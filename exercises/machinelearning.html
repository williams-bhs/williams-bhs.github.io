          Hexapawn is a turn-based game using six chess pawns on a \(3 \times 3\) board. White moves first. A piece can
          either move forward if the space in front of it is empty, or capture an opponent's piece diagonally.
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <table style="width:100%;">
              <tr>
                <td style="width:33%;margin:auto;"><img src="../img/hex.png"> </td>
                <td style="width:33%;margin:auto;"><img src="../img/move_forward.png"> </td>
                <td style="width:33%;margin:auto;"><img src="../img/move_diagonal.png"> </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>
          A player can win in 3 ways:
          <div style="width:80%;margin:auto;padding:15px;">
            &bull; One of their pawns reaches the other side <br>
            &bull; All of their opponent's pieces are captured <br>
            &bull; It is their opponent's turn and there is no legal move
          </div>
          Hexapawn is a <em>solved game</em>, meaning we can calculate an optimal move from any position. Start by
          playing several games to get familiar, and see if you can "solve" the game before attempting the questions
          below.

          <ol type="a">
            <li>Is it possible to draw (tie) in hexapawn?</li>
            <li>Does one side have the advantage?</li>
            <li>What is the shortest game possible (fewest moves)?</li>
            <li>What is the longest game possible (most moves)?</li>
            <li>How many unique positions are possible after the first move (only white moves)?</li>
            <li>How many unique positions are possible after the first two moves (white moves then black moves)?</li>
            <li>Give an example of a position that is impossible to reach.</li>
            <li>If white's first move is to move their left-most pawn forward, then what is black's best response? What
              is black's worst response?</li>
            <li>If white's first move is to move their center pawn forward, then what is black's best response? What is
              black's worst response?</li>
            <li>How many unique games are possible? Here, a game is represented by a sequence of moves.</li>

            Browse to <a href="https://jedediyah.github.io/hexapawn/">https://jedediyah.github.io/hexapawn/</a>. Try
            playing a few games. Experiment with letting the machine play itself until it solves the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the tree grows, there is more information recorded about the possible game outcomes. The
            machine is programmed to follow a path of least resistance when it moves. That is, it will make the
            move that leads to the least bad result in the tree at the time. The more games played, the more information
            is available so presumably the better the moves become.
          </p>
          <ol type="a">

            <li>As the machine plays itself, how do you know when the game has been solved?</li>
            <li>What is the shortest game in the tree? What is the longest game in the tree?</li>
            <li>After letting the machine play itself until one side always wins, there are still several games in the
              tree where each side has won. So how is it that one side will always win now? In other words, why are some
              previously reachable results now un-reachable?</li>
            <li>Why doesn't the tree expand completely? In other words, why won't every possible game get played?</li>
            <li>Find a game that hasn't yet been recorded in the tree, and play it into the tree.</li>
            <li>Refresh the website, and start the machine playing itself again. Does it generate the same tree each
              time? What might it say about the algorithm if the tree is the same or different?</li>
            <li>Refresh the website. Running one Machine vs. Machine game at a time, use the blank chart to keep track
              of the machine's score after each game. Each time black wins, the score increases by one. Each time white
              wins, the score decreases by one. Play enough games to solve Hexapawn.
              <ol>
                <li>How many games did it take before black always won?</li>
                <li>On average how many games does it take before black always wins? What was the fewest number of games
                  required? The most? It might be useful to ask your classmates to share their data.</li>
                <li>How many wins total did white have?</li>
                <li>On average how many wins did white have? What was the fewest number of wins for white? The most?
