      <h2>Sequence</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>sequence</strong> is an ordered list of terms. Sequences can be <strong>finite</strong> or
        <strong>infinite</strong>. Sequences can be listed or defined in a variety of ways. Here are some sequences:
        \[1,1,1,1,1,...\]
        \[2,4,6,8,10\]
        \[1,1,2,3,5,8,...\]
        \[0, 0.01, 0.0011, 0.000111, 0.00001111, ... \]
        \[\frac{0}{1},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{1}\]
        The ellipses (...) indicate that the sequence continues.
      </p>

      <h3>Formulating Sequences</h3>
      <p>
        An <strong>explicit formula</strong> is one that calculates the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of a sequence directly.
        The \(n^{\text{th}}\) perfect square is given by
        \[a_n = n^2 \]
        for \(n \geq 1\).
        The subscript is an index which refers to a particular term in a sequence. It is common to start with subscripts
        of either 0 or 1. The sequence defined by the formula above is \(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...\), where:
        \[a_1 = 1\]
        \[a_2 = 4\]
        \[a_3 = 9\]
        \[...\]
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>recursive definition</strong> consists of an <strong>initial condition</strong> and <strong>recurrence
          relation</strong> for calculating each term from previous terms. Consider:
        \[a_1 = \frac{1}{2}\]
        \[a_n = 3a_{n-1}\]
        This says that every term is equal to \(3\) times the previous term, with the first term being
        \(\frac{1}{2}\). This definition gives us the sequence:
        \[a_{1} = \frac{1}{2}\]
        \[a_{2} = \frac{3}{2}\]
        \[a_{3} = \frac{9}{2}\]
        \[a_{4} = \frac{27}{2}\]
      </p>

        <h4>Exercise</h4>

        <div class="solution">
          <p>
            To find \(a_6\) we would need:
            \[ a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4 \]
            but we do not know \(a_5\) or \(a_4\) yet. The typical strategy for evaluating terms recursivly is to start
            at the beginning and work up to our target term.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are given:
            \[a_0 = 3\]
            \[a_1 = 4\]
            and we continue with:
            \[a_2 = 2 \cdot 4 - 3 = 5 \]
            \[a_3 = 2 \cdot 5 - 4 = 6 \]
            \[a_4 = 2 \cdot 6 - 5 = 7 \]
            \[a_5 = 2 \cdot 7 - 6 = 8 \]
            \[a_6 = 2 \cdot 8 - 7 = 9 \]

          <p>
            We wish to compare these sequences to the triangular numbers
            \((0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21,\ldots)\text{,}\) when we start with
            \(n=0\text{,}\) and the powers of 2: \((1, 2, 4, 8,
            16, \ldots)\text{.}\)
          <ol>
            <li>
              \((1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, \ldots)\text{.}\) Note that if we subtract 1 from each term, we get
              the sequence \((T_n)\text{.}\) So we have \(b_n = T_n +
              1\text{.}\) Therefore a closed formula is \(b_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} +
              1\text{.}\) A quick check of the first few
              \(n\) confirms we have it right.
            </li>
            <li>
              \((3, 5, 9, 17, 33, \ldots )\text{.}\) Each term in this sequence is one more than a power of 2,
              so we might guess the closed formula is \(c_n = a_n+1 = 2^n +
              1\text{.}\) If we try this though, we get \(c_0 = 2^0 + 1 =
              2\) and \(c_1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3\text{.}\) We are off because the
              indices are shifted. What we really want is \(c_n = a_{n+1}+1\) giving
              \(c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1\text{.}\)
            </li>
            <li>
              (\(0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42,\ldots \)). Notice that all these terms are even. What happens if we factor out
              a 2? We get \((T_n)\text{!}\) More precisely, we find that \(d_n/2 =
              T_n\text{,}\) so this sequence has closed formula \(d_n =
              n(n+1)\text{.}\)
            </li>
            <li>
              \((3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, \ldots)\text{.}\) These are all triangular
              numbers. However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term. So if we
              could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for \(T_n\text{,}\) we
              would be set. Therefore the closed formula is \(e_n =
              \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}\) (where \(n+3\) came from \((n+2)+1\)). Thinking about sequences as
              functions, we are doing a horizontal shift by 2: \(e_n=T_{n+2}\) which would cause the graph to shift
              2 units to the left.
            </li>
            <li>
              \((0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, \ldots )\text{.}\) Try adding 1 to each term, and we get powers of 2. You
              might guess this because each term is a little more than twice the previous term (the powers of 2 are
              <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> twice the previous term). Closed formula: \(f_n=2^{n} -
              1\text{.}\)
            </li>
            <li>
              \((3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \ldots )\text{.}\) These numbers are also doubling each time, but are also
              all multiples of 3. Dividing each by 3 gives 1, 2, 4, 8, …. Aha. We get the closed formula
              \(g_n=3\cdot 2^{n}\text{.}\)
            </li>
            <li>
              \((6, 10, 18, 34, 66, \ldots )\text{.}\) To get from one term to the next, we almost double each
              term. So maybe we can relate this back to \(2^n\text{.}\) Yes, each
              term is 2 more than a power of 2. So we get \(h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2\) (the
              \(n+2\) is because the first term is 2 more than \(2^2\text{,}\) not \(2^0\)). Alternatively, we
              could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example: Starting with 3, 5, 9, 17, …
              we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence. That sequence had closed formula
              \(c_n=2^{n+1} + 1\text{.}\) Our sequence here would be twice this, so \(h_n=2(2^n + 1)\text{,}\) which
              is the same as what we got before.
            </li>
            <li>

              \((15, 33, 57, 87, 123, \ldots)\text{.}\) Try dividing each term by 3. That gives the sequence
              \(5, 11, 19, 29, 41,\ldots\text{.}\) Now add 1 to each term: \(6, 12,
              20, 30, 42, \ldots\text{,}\) which is \((d_n)\) in this
              example, except starting with 6 instead of 0. So let's
              start with the formula \(d_n= n(n+1)\text{.}\) To start with the 6, we
              shift: \((n+2)(n+3)\text{.}\) But this is one too many, so subtract 1:
              \((n+2)(n+3) - 1\text{.}\) That gives us our sequence, but divided by
              3. So we want \(j_n = 3((n+2)(n+3) - 1)\text{.}\)

            </li>

      <h3>Sequence Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        For an infinite sequence, a natural question regards the behavior of \(a_n\) as \(n\) goes to infinty.
        There are some common behaviors we want to be able to recognize and analyize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some sequences will just get bigger, tending toward \(\pm \infty\), for example:
        \[1,2,3,4,5,...\]
        \[2,4,6,8,10,...\]
        \[-2, -3, -5, -7, -11, -13, ...\]
        \[\sqrt{1}, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{4}, ...\]
      </p>
      <p>
        Other sequences <strong>converge</strong> to a single number. Cosider these sequences:
        \[ \frac{1}{1},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{6}, ... \]
        \[1, 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, ...\]
        \[ \frac{1}{1}, \frac{2}{2^2}, \frac{3}{3^2}, \frac{4}{4^2} \]
        For all of these sequences, \(a_n \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\), or using <strong>limit notation</strong>:
        \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0 \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Other sequences <strong>cycle</strong>. The sequence given by:
        \[a_0 = 3 \quad \quad a_n = -1 a_{n-1}\]
        is the alternating sequence:
        \[3, -3, 3, -3, 3, ...\]
        We would call this a \(2\)-cycle since it cycles between two values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other sequences do not cycle, converge, or go off to infinity. The sequence of digits in \(\pi\) are
        values from \(0\) to \(9\) that do not converge and do not cycle.
      </p>

      <h2>Sum</h2>
      <p>
        We will find several applications that involve summing a sequence. Even infinite sequences! Given the
        infinite sequence:
        \[ \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, ... \]
        The corresponding sum is:
        \[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + ... \]
        which amazingly is an infinite sum equal to \(1\).
        A formula for this sequence of reciprocal powers of \(2\) is:
        \[ a_n = \frac{1}{2^n} \quad \quad n \geq 1 \]
        which we can use to write the sum using
        <strong>sigma notation</strong>. That summation looks like:
        \[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} \]
        where the subscript \(n=1\) represents the starting value of \(n\) and the superscript represents the final
        value.

        We can also write sums of finite sequences or <strong>partial sums</strong> of infinite sequences. The
        sum of the first five perfect squares is:
        \[\sum_{i=1}^{5} x^2 = (1)^2 + (2)^2 + (3)^2 + (4)^2 + (5)^2\]
